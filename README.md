# Escrow-Contract

Escrow contracts hold funds for parties, then release the funds when both of them have duly unburdened their contractual responsibilities.

In the instant case, the buyer initiates the contract. He funds the escrow and releases the funds when the seller has fulfilled his own part of the deal. By the way, I want to write another escrow in the future where both the buyer and seller will have equal power over the contract.

## Credit

I learned how to build this contract from [Samy's repo](https://github.com/samyukthagopalsamy/ESCROW-SmartContract). Shout out to them.

## Contract Overveiw

This are the things the seller can do in this contract:
* confirm sending the product
* receive funds

The buyer:
* funding the contract
* releasing the funds
* confirm product delivery

Both parties can assertain the balance.

## What I learned in this contract

1. I learned something new. You can actually make the name of a struct a separate variable name. This is easier both for readability and initialization. Read the contract for context.

2. Then I upgraded my knowledge of operators and operand. You know, I got to use "&&!" and some other rare operators.

This project was fun
